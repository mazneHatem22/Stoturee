              <p className="mt-4">
                Our journey began in 2021 as a startup offering design, <br/>
                photography, and media services, where we provided <br/> creative
                solutions to meet our clients' needs.
              </p>
              <p className="mt-4">
                Over time, and with the success of our projects, we moved <br/> to
                Dubai to expand our services and provide a <br/> comprehensive
                experience that reflects the unique identity <br/> of each client.
              </p>
              <p className="mt-4">
                What sets Stoture apart is our commitment to quality and <br/>
                flexibility, as we work according to well-thought-out <br/> strategies
                and clear plans that ensure the achievement of <br/> our clients'
                ambitions. We do not just provide designs; we <br/> build visual
                stories that inspire and highlight our clients'<br/>Â visions.
